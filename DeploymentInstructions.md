# Deployment Instructions for Node.js and React Application

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:
- Node.js installed
- npm (Node Package Manager) installed
- XAMPP for database management using PHPMyAdmin

## Step 1: Install Node.js
1. Download the Node.js installer from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. Verify the installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal. This will display the Node.js and npm versions if installed correctly.

## Step 2: Install XAMPP
1. Download XAMPP from [Apache Friends website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
2. Install XAMPP by following the setup wizard. Ensure PHPMyAdmin is selected during the installation options.
3. Start the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL modules. Ensure both are running.

## Step 3: Setup the Backend
1. Clone or download the backend source code to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the backend directory in the terminal.
3. Install all dependencies by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Ensure the backend is configured to connect to MySQL via XAMPP and check if it is set to automatically create the database if not existing.

## Step 4: Setup the Frontend
1. Clone or download the frontend source code to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the frontend directory in the terminal.
3. Install all dependencies by running:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Ensure the frontend is set up to connect to your backend service.

## Step 5: Run the Application
1. Start the backend server by running:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This command will start the Node.js server, typically accessible via `http://localhost:8081`.
2. In another terminal, start the frontend application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will usually start the React application on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Step 6: Access the Application
Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the frontend of the application. The backend should be running and connected to the database managed through PHPMyAdmin.

Congratulations, your application should now be running locally!
